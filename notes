- in current directory make a new folder named the series name - and make sure invalid charecters are not saved as folder name
- in that folder make cbz files for each chapter

if a folder in the name of the series already exists only download chapters that are not already in that folder
- first check if there isn't a folder in current directory named our series, then check if current directory itself is not named after our series - then make a new folder in current directory that is our series

use a folder, download pictures inside, create a cbr from files in folder
^call this folder working directory - create on every run, delete at end of every run

when download done - run this in working directory - run bach -c
zip ../(chapter name here).cbr *
rm -rf ./

if -v is applied print when a chapter finishes downloading
and also print each picture download like 3/36 and then zipping, and then done - make sure updates on same line with \r and if last message longer than next have enough spaces to remove it
don't forget to fflush
