Be able to set percentage of similarity needed

Would like to not save file after every chapter, but keep like a snapshot after
each chapter instead, and save that snapshot on exit...

make an install.sh
support mangasee
also make default for mangasee not to check for duplicates
mangasee - chapter label - name of chapter
seires page has array of page one of all chapters in reverse order
series page also has seriesName 
page one of each chapter contains link to every page and the page number it is too

have some automated testing toold

comment all methods
and global variables

also allow options like download from 000 ect.
and if they put in a chapter download from that chapter onwards ect.

what if instead of series just a chapter page is given - then just download the chapter

clean up code!!

quick fail downloading chapters - and move on don't exit

keep auto-updating desired mangas - just run the url every day automatically or whatever
store somewhere where to update from and so if you just run tmdl in that folder it'll just work on updating it

improve the verbose print

impliment download of a single chapter kissMangaDownload.c:78

make a massive defines file for all the places I search for in source code to get stuff so if the site changes its easier to update

have a --version option and a update option - write and executes a script as sudo that checks github for version change

improve error messages
