make an install.sh
NEED A SIMILAIRTY CHECK - sadly most scanlators don't just copy and paste their image
they put the chapter in so it changes ever so slightly
use findimagedupes
an experimental option -e
basically at the end unzip everything into folders do a massive findimagedupes check
read output (ignore lines starting with Warning)
and delete all those files, then depending of weather zip or folder is set, rezip everything or leave as is
remeber to put that this is experimental - needs decent time and cpu and is innaccurate, not reccomended
support mangasee

have some automated testing toold

comment all methods
and global variables

also allow options like download from 000 ect.
and if they put in a chapter download from that chapter onwards ect.

what if instead of series just a chapter page is given - then just download the chapter

clean up code!!

quick fail downloading chapters - and move on don't exit

keep auto-updating desired mangas - just run the url every day automatically or whatever
store somewhere where to update from and so if you just run tmdl in that folder it'll just work on updating it

-hashmap of md5-hashes of pictures and location
-at first duplicate, unzip folder delete file, rezip, remove location data from hashmap, and delete the just downloaded file, if duplicate found and location is null, only delete new one
when deleting a file allow file name to be incremented so if the user finds a missing page they can go online and find what page is missing
-hashmap stores a struct with the key, chapter and file name
-comparator is a strcmp wrapper
-change the way save file is read and all
- if new url run in the folder - update the .settings file given the name of the magnga ends up the same

improve the verbose print

impliment download of a single chapter kissMangaDownload.c:78

make a massive defines file for all the places I search for in source code to get stuff so if the site changes its easier to update

the .settings file - if it's read then that means that do not set folder name from website
also change argument error, only is a valid settings file is found you can run tmdl with no arguments

have a --version option and a update option - write and executes a script as sudo that checks github for version change

where to start load? - at series location, also save at end of normal execution and at exit

improve error messages

ability to update url of a folder? :/

check and make sure -u with multiple folderss works cuz I didn't specifically impiment that
